## Project Description
I'm going to build a music mobile app, that allows you to create a party similar to xbox live party. You can create, and join existing parties. You can search for songs and add them to the parties queu. On that queu, users can give votes to songs on there,the higher the vote number is the higher in the queu the song goes, you can also down vote a song.


## Problem Statement
Problem is that when you're in social settings listening to music can be a pain because people don't know what to play or whose in control. 


## How will your project solve this problem?
This app let's everyone be in control, everyone can add their favorite songs to the queu and also plays music that's more popular.
